# The-Town-Of-Salem-Mini-Game
This is a simplified version of the game "The town of Salem"

IN THIS GAME THERE ARE 7 PLAYERS WHO EACH HAVE A ROLE.

THE ROLES ARE:

1) CITIZEN 
2) DOCTOR 
3) GANGSTER.

AT THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME AN ALGORITHM RANDOMLY DECIDES THE ROLE OF EACH 
PLAYER. THERE IS ONE DOCTOR, ONE GANGSTER AND THE REST ARE CITIZENS. THE GAME IS DIVIDED INTO 2 
PHASES, NIGHT AND DAY.

IN THE NIGHT PHASE THE CIVILIANS "SLEEP" AND THE GANGSTER CHOOSES A PLAYER TO LEAVE 
FROM THE GAME. THEN THE DOCTOR CHOOSES A PLAYER TO SAVE HIM FROM THE GANGSTER. IF HE CHOOSES 
THE PLAYER CHOSEN BY THE GANGSTER, NO ONE LEAVES (HE CANNOT SAVE HIMSELF). AT 
AT THE END OF THE NIGHT IT GETS ANNOUNCED WHICH PLAYER HAS BEEN KILLED. 

IN THE DAY PHASE, PLAYERS VOTE FOR ONE OF THE REMAINING PLAYERS TO RETIRE.
THE PLAYER WITH THE MOST VOTES LEAVES THE GAME. 

THIS PROCESS (I.E. THE NIGHT-DAY PHASES) IS REPEATED UNTIL THE 
GANGSTER OR UNTIL ALL CIVILIANS AND THE DOCTOR LEAVE. 

IF THE GANGSTER LEAVES WHILE THERE ARE STILL CIVILIANS OR THE DOCTOR, THE CIVILIANS WIN. IF THERE ARE TWO 
PLAYERS AND ONE OF THEM IS THE GANGSTER, THE GANGSTER WINS THE GAME.
